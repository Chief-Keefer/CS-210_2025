1. For each problem, state its goal in your own words and describe your approach to solve the 
problem along with any issues you encountered and if/how you managed to solve those issues.

[Problem 1 (Greet Three)]

Goal: Printing arguments given from standard input to standard output

Approach: It was a fairly straight forward program with no issues. The first thing we always do, on any program, is store the arguments within a variable.
Then I print those variables using the standard out library.

[Problem 2 (Three Sort)]

Goal: Sorting three integers given from standard input

Approach: No issues encoutered on this one. I found the largest of the three numbers by using Math.max on integers x and the Math.max of integers y and z.
Then I found the minimum by doing the same thing but with Math.min. Then to get the middle number, I added up all 3 integers and then subtracted the max and min numbers from the total.

[Problem 3 (Great Circle Distance)]

Goal: Performing complex arithmetic and outputting the result to standard output

Approach: This problem was fairly easy, no issues. First, I had to convert the doubles given from standard input from degrees to radian and store them in their respective variables.
Then perform the calculation using the formula given and outputting to standard output.

[Problem 4 (Uniform Random Numbers)]

Goal: Use the StdRandom library to get a 3 random numbers, and then use those numbers to find their mean, variance, and standard deviation.

Approach: This problem was also fairly easy, with no issues. First, I stored 2 ints given from standard input and added one to the upper boundary because StdRandom gives a random number between a and b, not inclusive.
Then I stored 3 random numbers from the upper and lower boundary in their respective variables. Next, I found the mean, standard deviation, and variance by using the random numbers from before and the formulas given.
Finally, I output the mean, standard deviation, and variance on the same line

[Problem 5 (Triangle Inequality)]

Goal: Using boolean conditions and printing the output of the condition.

Approach: This problem was straightforward with no problems. First, as always, we store 3 integers given to us in their respective variables.
Then we print the value of the condition: if each one of the values are less than or equal to the sum of the other too.

[Problem 6 (Quadratic Equation)]

Goal: Implementing conditional statements to check on variables. Performing arithmetic on values given from standard input and printing the value

Approach: Another straightforward program, we perform a check on the first value given to determine whether it is < 0. Then calculate the roots using the quadratic equation and print them

[Problem 7 (Six-sided Die)]

Goal: Using if statements to decide which face of the die to print

Approach: This was one of the more easier problems to solve. First, we get a random number from 1 to 7 non inclusive. Then depending on that number, we print the face corresponding to the number to standard output

[Problem 8 (Playing Card)]

Goal: Implenting if statements and using the StdRandom library to decide which card to print

Approach: Another one of the more easier problems. It is very similar to the Die program, but instead we get 2 random numbers denoting the number of the card and the suit. Then depending on those two numbers,
we print the corresponding number and suit to standard output

[Problem 9 (Greatest Common Divisor)]

Goal: Using while loop to find the GCD

Approach: No issues with this one as well. We take in two ints from standard input. Then we use a while loop until we find the GCD. Inside the while loop, we find the GCD using the mod operator

[Problem 10 (Factorial Function)]

Goal: Implementing for loops to find the Factorial of a number

Approach: This was a fairly easy problem. We take in a value, n, from standard input, and we declare an int denoting the result and set it to 1. Next, we use a for loop up to n, where we start at 1, to
multiply the result by the index
